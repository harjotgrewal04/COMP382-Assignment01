### **1. Nondeterministic Finite Automaton**
#### **1.1 Finite Automaton**
Finite Automan are machines which determine if a string is apart of some language. Based upon input of symbols or characters which are given to the machine it wil processe each one step-by-step. If the input leaves the machine in an accepting state then the input is accepted whereas if it is any other state it will be rejected. 

Finite Automaton is configured of a 5-tuple notation:
  - Q is the finite set of states
  - Σ is a finite set of alphabet
  - δ is the transition function defined by δ: Q x Σ --> Q
  - q₀ is the assigned start state
  - F ⊆ Q is the set of accept states which must belong to the set of all states
