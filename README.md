### **1. Nondeterministic Finite Automaton**
#### **1.1 Finite Automaton**
Finite Automaton is configured of a 5-tuple notation:
- Q is the finite set of states
- Σ is a finite set of alphabet
- δ is the transition function defined by δ: Q x Σ --> Q
- q₀ is the assigned start state
- F ⊆ Q is the set of accept states which must belong to the set of all states
